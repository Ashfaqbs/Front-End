                    <li>What is JavaScript</li>
                    <pre>

JavaScript is a single threaded(means one thing at a time) , non blocking ,Asynchronous concurrent language(At a time more then one thing can  happen)<br>
IT has a call stack , an event loop , and a callback queue + other API's(fetch ,Settimeout ....) <br>
V8  is the JavaScript runtime which has callstack and heap <br> 
The heap is used for memory allocations(memory)and stack holds the execution context(which to call next ,and a function is called then it and the data in it will be destroyed) <br>
DOM, Settimeout, XML, HTTPrequest, dont exist in V8 source code

    <li>What is Call stack</li>

    <pre>

        //Call stack

        function greeting() {


            hi()
            return "greeting"
        }

        function hi() {

            return "hi"
        }


        greeting();


        // then greeting will be the 1st to go to the Call stack here and in greeting we alo have hi , so hi()
        // will go next in the call stack and it will execute and will be popped and greeting will be executed and popped and as soon as a function is popped all the data init and the function will destroyed 



    </pre>
    <li>Asynchronous callback</li>
    <pre>
sometimes the JavaScript code can take a lot of time and this can block the page re render <br>
JavaScript has asynchronous callbacks for non blocking behaviour <br>
JavaScript runtime can do only one thing at a time <br>
browser gives us other things which work along the runtme like web API's <br>
In node Js these are available as c++ API's



    </pre>
    <li>Task Queue</li>
    <pre>


        JavaScript can do only thing at a time <br>
        The rest are Queued to the task queue waiting to be executed <br>
        when we run the setTimeout , webapi's will run timer and push the function provided the setTimeout to the task queue once timer ends <br>
        These tasks will be pushed to the stack where they can be executed

    </pre>
    <li>Event Loop</li>
    <pre>
JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop , which is responsible for executing the code , collecting and processing events and executing Queued sub-tasks <br>
the event loop pushes the tasks from the task queue to the call stack <br>
        Settimeout(func1(),0) can be used to defer a function until all the pending tasks (so far) have been executed <br>
        We can see how these things work in action by visiting
