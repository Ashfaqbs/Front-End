    <h1>localStorage & related methods </h1>
    <caption>Local storage helps in storing the data of a particular domain,Same also stores the data as cookie as KEY
        and value pair</caption>
    <h2>Local Storage is a web storage object which are not sent to the server with each request, Cookie is sent to the
        server with every request, but sometimes we dont want to send the data to the server then we use Local storage
    </h2>
    <h2>This data survives a full page refresh and even a full browser restart , the data will remain even if we refresh
        or restart the browser <br>
        eg: we want to save the user data , but we dont want to save the data and send to server everytime so we will
        use localStorage and not cookie
    </h2>

        <h3>

//Setting a localStorage or we can directly run in browser console
            localStorage.setItem('name','sonu')

            //Getting a item saved in localStorage by the key 
            localStorage.getItem('name')
'sonu'

even we refresh we will get the data , and localStorage key and value pairs are seen in browser> application> Storage >localStorage and our details will be seen

copy the url where you set the localStorage in the browser i.e http://127.0.0.1:5500/Practise/C10(FetchApi-cookies-localStorage-SessionStorage)/LocalStorage-&-related-methods.html

and now close the browser and open and paste the url you can see the details in localStorage

<h2>Important Note</h2>
1.Both key and value must be Strings 
2.We can use the two JSON methods to store objects in localStorage
JSON.Stringify(object)->Converts objects to JSON Strings
JSON.Parse(String) -> Converts String to objects(Must be a valid JSON)


<h2>Some Important methods are</h2>
<ul>
    <li>setItem(key,value)</li>
    Store data in key value pair
    localStorage.setItem('id',1)

    <li>getItem(key)</li>
    get the value by key
    <li>removeItem(key)</li>
    remove the key with the value
    localStorage.setItem('id',1)
localStorage.removeItem('id')

localStorage
Storage{name: 'sonu', length: 1}
    <li>clear()</li>
    delete all the data stored in localStorage
  
    localStorage.clear()
    localStorage
    Storage {length: 0}
  
    <li>key(index)</li>
    get the key on a given position

    localStorage.setItem('name','sonu')
localStorage.key(0)
'name'
    <li>length</li>
    the number of stored items 
         localStorage.length
       1

    
    
    
    We can get and set values like an object 
    localStorage.one=1
    alert(localStorage.one)
//
    localStorage.one=1
1
localStorage
Storage {name: 'sonu', one: '1', length: 2}
    
</ul>
