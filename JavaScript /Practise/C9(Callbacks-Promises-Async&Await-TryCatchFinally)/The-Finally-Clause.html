    <h1>The Finally Clause</h1>

    <b>
        <h2>
            When we have added try catch to a code , if error is expected then it try and catch runs else only try
            executes
            and
            catch is ignored, but we can also use Finally block as it will run if we get error or not
            <br>
            the finally will run if there are issues/ no issues anf if there is return in a function just before
            returning the finally clause will execute and return will executed next
