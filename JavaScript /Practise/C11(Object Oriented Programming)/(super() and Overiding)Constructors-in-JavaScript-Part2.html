    <h1>Constructors super() and Overriding in JavaScript Part2</h1>
    <caption></caption>


    <pre>
        <b>
            <h3>
Super()
This is used when ever we define a constructor in child classes we need to explicitly add super() in those constructor 
and whenever we need to call the parent function from child class we call from super().function()
<h1>Note

when ever we Inheritance is seen , and parent class had constructor()
 and child classes doesnot have any Constructors then while creating
  object for the children the JavaScript engine will create a default
   constructor and add super() in the child classes , 
   and we can manually add this , and we should always call 
   this keyword after super() has been called 



</h1>







Method Overriding(No need to add any annotation on the method just add in child class and change the logic)
Providing custom implementation with respect to the specific class then the base/parent class
