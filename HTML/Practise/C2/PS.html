    The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
     Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the 
     dog's nearest living relative.[8] Dogs were the first species to be domesticated[9][8] by hunter-gatherers
      over 15,000 years ago[7] before the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association 
     with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability
     to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]

    The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
    [12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, 
    such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship,
     therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human 
     behavior, and the humanâ€“canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.[13]
      This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".[14]

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>

    In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature). Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog",[15] and under this genus,
     he listed the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus.[2] Linnaeus considered the dog to be a
     separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata), which is not found 
     in any other canid.[16]

In 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) indicated that the domestic dog may have originated 
from the grey wolf, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog breeds having developed at a time when human communities were more isolated from each other.[17] In the third edition of Mammal Species of the 
World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis lupus its wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies, which formed the domestic dog clade: familiaris, 
as named by Linnaeus in 1758 and, dingo named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior synonym) for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mtDNA 
study as one of the guides informing his decision.[3] Mammalogists have noted the inclusion
 of familiaris and dingo together under the "domestic dog" clade[18] with some debating it.[19]
